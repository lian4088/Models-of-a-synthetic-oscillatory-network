# Synthetic Oscillatory Network: Repressilator Simulation

This project simulates the dynamics of a synthetic gene regulatory network called the **Repressilator**, originally proposed by Elowitz and Leibler (2000), using a deterministic system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The Repressilator is a synthetic cyclic network composed of three transcriptional repressors — LacI, TetR, and λ cI — each repressing the next in a loop. This negative feedback system generates periodic oscillations in both mRNA and protein concentrations, forming a simple synthetic biological clock.

## 🔬 Model Overview

- The network consists of three coupled pairs of mRNA-protein ODEs (6 total).
- The model uses:
  - Hill repression function for transcription
  - First-order degradation for both mRNA and proteins
  - Empirical parameters drawn from biological estimates
- Simulation conducted using `scipy.integrate.odeint` in Python.

## 🧪 Simulation Highlights

- Initial conditions set for symmetrical or asymmetrical analysis
- Oscillations observed in both mRNA and protein concentrations
- Time series visualizations of LacI, TetR, and cI regulators

## 🧬 Simulation Results

### 🔁 Oscillation under typical initial conditions

![Protein Oscillation - Typical](image/protein%20dynamics.png)

This plot shows the protein concentration dynamics of the repressilator system under standard asymmetric initial conditions. The oscillations stabilize over time with clear periodicity and phase shift among LacI, TetR, and cI proteins.

### 🔄 Oscillation under symmetrical initial condition

![Protein Oscillation - Symmetrical Init](image/repressor%20of%20asym%20initial%20condition.png)

In this simulation, all mRNAs start with equal values. The system still exhibits oscillatory behavior but with altered phase and amplitude, illustrating the sensitivity to initial condition symmetry.
